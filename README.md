#Explanation of the repo

This repository is prepared for the final project of Coursera course Getting and Cleaning data as described here
  : https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project/submit

This script serves as the high level description of the project. 

The file CodeBook.MD provides a description of the variables, transformations, meanings of the variable names. 

Such transformations were done both to variables as well as their names in the table. 

Finally, the script run_analysis.R provides R code to perform the analysis. 

It assumes the script is in the work directory. 

It further assumes that the original data files are in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory 

with train and test folders unchanged from the original zip download from the source
